# GC-System
A Discord Bot!

This project is to create a master, awesome, all in one, bot for the Game Corner Community and any other server that wants to use it!

**Blog:** [GC-System Blog](https://game-corner.000webhostapp.com/gc-system-blog/) 

This bot can be used for educational purposes as it provides a introduction to Javascript -> Node.js -> Discord.js and allows the user to:
1. Create commands and edit them.
2. Edit functions of the bot to create the personal server experience
2. Edit the bot GitHub repository within the Discord enviroment.
